# fake-news-detectionWelcome to the Fake News Detection Project Read Me file!

In this project, we aim to build a machine learning model that can classify news articles as either real or fake. This is an important task because fake news can have a significant impact on individuals, organizations, and even societies as a whole. By accurately detecting fake news, we can help prevent misinformation from spreading and improve the overall quality of news media.

To build our fake news detection model, we will be using a dataset of news articles that have been labeled as either real or fake. We will use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text data and extract relevant features. Then, we will train several machine learning models on this preprocessed data and evaluate their performance to determine the best model for our task.

The main files included in this project are:

fake_news_dataset.csv: This file contains the raw data we will be working with. It includes news articles along with their corresponding labels (0 for real news and 1 for fake news).

data_preprocessing.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for preprocessing the data, including text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.

model_training.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for training and evaluating several machine learning models on the preprocessed data.

fake_news_detection_model.pkl: This is a serialized version of the trained machine learning model that can be used for predicting the labels of new news articles.

We hope that this project will help you gain a better understanding of NLP techniques and how they can be applied to real-world problems. Please feel free to explore the code and experiment with different models and parameters. Good luck!
