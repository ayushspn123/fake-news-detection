## Project Overview

In today's digital era, the spread of fake news is a concerning issue. This project tackles the problem by building a machine learning model capable of detecting fake news. The model will be trained on a dataset of labeled news articles, enabling it to identify patterns and indicators of fake or misleading content. By utilizing this model, users can make more informed decisions about the authenticity of the news they encounter.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone 
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r 
   ```
3. Download any additional resources, such as pre-trained models or word embeddings, and place them in the appropriate directories.

## Usage

After completing the installation steps, you can use the project as follows:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the main script or execute the desired code file:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
3. Follow the instructions or refer to the code documentation for specific usage guidelines.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of news articles labeled as either genuine or fake. It includes a diverse range of articles from various sources, providing a representative sample of the types of content encountered in the real world. The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size, but it can be obtained from [link to dataset source] or by following the instructions provided in the `data/README.md` file.

## Model Training

The model training process involves the following steps:

1. Load and preprocess the news article dataset.
2. Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
3. Perform text preprocessing, including tokenization and vectorization.
4. Build and configure the machine learning model, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a transformer-based model.
5. Train the model using the training set.
6. Validate the model's performance on the validation set.
7. Save the trained model weights for future use.

For more details on the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training procedure, refer to the code documentation or the `model_training.ipynb` notebook.

## Evaluation

The performance of the trained model can be evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Evaluation involves using a separate test set of unlabeled news articles. The trained model predicts the authenticity of these articles, which is then compared against the ground truth labels to calculate the evaluation metrics.
